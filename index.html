        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          State and metropolitan area governments are facing substantial new
          challenges when planning for the future. They can no longer assume
          that past trends will continue into the future given the emergence of
          new transportation technologies, such as self-driving cars, and
          pressing problems, such as the need to greatly limit carbon emissions.
          Moreover, there are many questions about how the future may unfold
          such as: how much will the price of gas increase? will millennials
          continue to drive less than previous generations as they age? and will
          the availability of self-driving cars increase driving?
        </p>
        <p>
          These challenges and uncertainties require a strategic approach to
          planning in which many possibilites for future trends are considered
          along with many potential policies and actions for influencing those
          trends and their effects on communities. Analytical methods and tools
          need to be able to consider many factors of interest and need to be
          executed rapidly so that many potential futures and courses of action
          may be analyzed. In addition, planners need to have the means to
          efficiently sift through and make sense of the results of those
          analyses.
        </P>
        <p>
          This document provides an overview of a pilot project to create
          methods for developing and analyzing hundreds of future transportation
          and land use scenarios using the Rapid Policy Assessment Tool (RPAT).
          It also demonstrates an interactive visualization tool that planners
          and others may use to explore and make sense of the results. All
          project documents and code are available in the project's GitHub
          repository:

        <h3>Rapid Policy Assessment Tool (RPAT)</h3>
        <p> The Rapid Policy Assessment Tool is a strategic planning model for
          metropolitan areas that enables users to analyze the effects of different
          land use and transportation scenarios on a number of outcomes such as
          emissions, congestion, vehicle travel, and costs. The RPAT was developed
          as part of the SHRP 2 C16 project, which provided tools, methods, and
          resources for transportation planning agencies in the United States to
          evaluate the effects of smart growth policies on travel demand. The
          following links provide additional information about the RPAT.

        <h3>Running Multiple RPAT Scenarios</h3>
        <p>
          Although the RPAT software runs quickly, the interface is not
          designed to enable users to easily set up and run large numbers of
          scenarios. The pilot project developed methods and modified the RPAT
          software to overcome this limitation. A test was executed in which
          over 300 scenarios were developed and analyzed using the RPAT. In
          addition, a data visualization application was developed to display
          the results of the analysis. A summary of the methods developed for
          creating and running multiple scenarios is presented below. The data
          visualization application is presented in the next tab of this web
          page.
         </p>
         <p>
           The RPAT software is operated with a graphical user interface (GUI)
           that is designed to assist users with organizing and formatting
           inputs, starting the model, and viewing summary results. Although
           the GUI makes it easier for RPAT users to operate the tool without errors,
           it forces users to set up and run one scenario at a time. This is a
           cumbersome way to set up and evaluate a large number of scenarios.
           Fortunately, the GUI is a layer on top of several
           <a href="http://www.r-project.org"> R language </a>
           scripts that perform all of the model calculations. Moreover, all
           scenario inputs are stored in text files that are easily edited in
           a spreadsheet program. This enables a scenario development and model
           run process to be scripted and run using the R command interface.
           Two R scripts were created to do this: make_scenarios.r, and
           run_many_scenarios.r. These scripts and documentation are available in
           the project's
           <a href="https://github.com/gregorbj/RPAT_Viewer_Pilot"> GitHub repository.</a>
         </p>
         <p>
           The RPAT installation program installs a number of R and Python scripts.
           Only 3 of the RPAT R scripts are needed to carry out the method
           summarized here and documented in the GitHub repository. In addition,
           The demo input files are needed to provide templates for the scenario
           inputs. The file structure needed to organize these files, the RPAT
           scripts, and the make_scenarios.r and run_many_scenarios.r scripts are
           described in the project documentation.
         </p>
         <p>
           The make_scenarios.r script uses a
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment"> full factorial </a>
           design approach for the development of scenarios. A user organizes
           inputs whose effects are to be studied in categories and then develops
           several sets of input files in each category to reflect different
           levels of influence. For example the demo used the following categories
           and levels:
         </p>
         <ul>
           <li>B - Bikes/Light-weight Vehicles</li>
           <ol>
             <li>Base bike diversion (9.75%)</li>
             <li>Double bike diversion (19.5%)</li>
           </ol>
           <li>C - Cost (vehicle mileage charge)</li>
           <ol>
             <li>Base (no charge)</li>
             <li>4 cents per mile</li>
             <li>8 cents per mile</li>
           </ol>
           <li>D - Demand Management</li>
           <ol>
             <li>Base</li>
             <li>Double all participation rates</li>
             <li>Double all participation rates and transit subsidy level</li>
           </ol>
           <li>L - Land Use</li>
           <ol>
             <li>Base (growth proportions by place type same as base year proportions)</li>
             <li>Halve suburban population growth and shift that portion to urban core</li>
           </ol>
           <li>P - Parking</li>
           <ol>
             <li>Base (existing costs and existing proportions of trips affected)</li>
             <li>Increase trips affected by 20%</li>
             <li>Double parking cost as well as increase trips affected by 20%</li>
           </ol>
           <li>T - Transit</li>
           <ol>
             <li>Base (supply stays at present level)</li>
             <li>Double transit supply</li>
             <li>Triple transit supply</li>
           </ol>
         </ul>
       <p>
         The make_scenarios.r script creates a scenario for each combination of
         category levels along with input files that do not vary by scenario.
         The total number of scenarios created is the product of the number of
         levels in each category; 324 for the demo.
       </p>
       <p>
         The run_scenarios.r script runs the RPAT model for each of the scenarios
         successively. After all of the runs have been completed, the script
         compiles the outputs produced by RPAT into a set of files, one for
         each of the performance measures calculated by RPAT, where results for
         all scenarios are included in each file. The script also produces a
         summary file of key performance measures for all scenarios that is
         used in the interactive data visualization.

                <h3>About Scenario Sensitivity Testing</h3>
                <p>
                The sensitivity tests displayed were conducted to test the potential for modifying the RPAT software to run multiple scenarios and to display the results by modifying the scenario viewer web app developed for the Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM). Preliminary inputs for the Corvallis Metropolitan Planning Area (CAMPO) RPAT project were modified to create these scenarios. Selected inputs were changed to different degrees. Then all combinations of the input variations were run as scenarios. This web app shows the results for several summary outputs. Note that the scenarios were developed solely for the purpose of testing out software modifications for running multiple scenarios and for displaying those scenarios in this viewer. Read the "Quick Start" and "Detailed Instructions" for more information.
                </p>
                <h3>About the Scenario Viewer</h3>
                <p>
                This web page enables you to explore the results of these sensitivity tests. With it, you can select different combinations of factors and find out how various future outcomes are affected by your selection. You can also select desired outcomes and find out what factors cause those outcomes to occur. By experimenting with the selections and observing the results, you will get a better understanding of the relationships between policy choices and context factors and future outcomes.

                <h3>Categories</h3>
                <p>Many factors such as parking pricing and transit supply affect light duty vehicle travel. Because the number of factors considered is large, they were grouped into 6 categories as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bicycles</strong> The diversion of single-occupant vehicle travel to bicycles, electric bicycles and other light-weight vehicles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demand Management</strong> Programs and incentives which encourage people to drive less including ridesharing, van pooling, telecommuting, and transit subsidies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Land Use</strong> The form in which development occurs (density, regional assessibility, mixed use, etc.) represented by the distribution of population and employment by place type.</li>
                <li><strong>Parking</strong> The extent of paid parking and its price.</li>
                <li><strong>Transit</strong> The extent and frequency of transit service.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Travel Cost</strong> The combination of fuel prices and vehicle travel charges to pay for roadways and to pay for externalities such as carbon pricing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Levels</h3>
                <p>Several levels were defined for each of the categories. These levels are numbered to indicate the amount of change from a <em>reference case</em> which represents the continuation of adopted local plans, policies and trends.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Corresponds to current conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Levels 2-3:</strong> Representing more ambitious policies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The levels are displayed in pie charts, one for each category, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
                <img src="img/piechart.png" width="95%">
                <p>Each pie chart has a legend showing the color associated with each level.  The sizes of the pie slices show the proportions of the selected scenarios in each each level.  The number of selected scenarios in each level is shown in the corresponding pie slices.  You can select (or deselect) the scenarios in a level by either clicking on the pie slice or the corresponding legend entry.  The selected level is colored and the non-selected levels are <em>grayed-out</em>.</p>
                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>Given the chosen category inputs, the web page also shows future year outcomes for the following performance measures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fatalities & Injuries:</strong> annual traffic fatalities and injuries per 1000 persons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle Cost Per Capita:</strong> average annual cost for owning & operating vehicles per person.</li>
                    <li><strong>DVMT Per Capita:</strong> average daily vehicle miles traveled per person.</li>
                    <li><strong>GHG Emissions Per Capita:</strong> average annual metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fuel Consumption:</strong> average annual gallons of gasoline and other fuels consumed per person.</li>
                    <li><strong>DVHT Per Capita:</strong> average daily vehicle hours of travel per person.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each outcome is illustrated in a bar chart showing the range of outcome values for the selected scenarios.  The bar height indicates the number of selected scenarios with that outcome value. The average value for all of the selected scenarios is shown above the bar chart.  The following illustrations shows what the <em>Fatalities & Injuries</em>, <em>Vehicle Cost Per Capita</em>, and <em>DVMT Per Capita</em> bar charts look like when all scenarios are selected.</p>

                <p>The bar charts can also be used to make a selection of scenarios.  This can be done by hovering the mouse cursor over the bar at one end of the desired selection range.  When the cursor is in the shape of a crosshairs, click and drag the mouse cursor to the other end of the desired range.  The bar chart will change to show the selected range.  In addition, handles will appear at the ends of the selected range.  You can click one these and drag it to alter the selection.  You can also click on the middle of the selection (when the shape of the cursor is a crossed arrow) to drag the whole selection to a different location on the bar chart.  As you make a selection in one bar chart, all the other bar charts will change to show just the selected scenarios.  The pie charts will also change accordingly.  The following illustration shows a selection made on the <em>Fatalities & Injuries</em> bar chart and the corresponding values for the other bar charts in the row.  You can see in the picture the crossed-arrow cursor shape which means that the whole selection can be dragged to a new position.</p>

                <p>Selections can be made simultaneously on multiple pie charts and bar charts.  As more selections are made, all of the charts will be updated to show the selections that meet all of the selection conditions.  To clear all of the selections and show all of the scenarios, just click on one of the <em>Clear All Selections</em> links on the web page.</p>
                <h3>Selected Scenario Table</h3>
                <p>Finally, at the bottom of the web page is a table which shows the data for the selected scenarios.  The values in this table can be copied and saved in a spreadsheet.  To select the data to copy, double-click in the top left-hand cell, press the <em>Shift</em> key, and then click in the bottom right-hand cell.  Once the data has been selected, copy it by pressing the <em>Ctrl c</em> keys for a Windows computer or the <em>Command c</em> keys for an Apple Macintosh computer.  Paste as unicode text into the spreadsheet of your choice.</p>
