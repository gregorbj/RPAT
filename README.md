# RPAT Viewer Pilot#
This project documents work related to the [Rapid Policy Assessment Tool](https://planningtools.transportation.org/10/travelworks.html) (RPAT). RPAT is a strategic planning model for metropolitan areas which enables users to analyze the effects of different land use and transportation scenarios on a number of outcomes such as emissions, congestion, vehicle travel, and costs. The tool was developed as part of the SHRP 2 C16 project, which provided tools, methods, and resources for transportation planning agencies in the United States to evaluate the effects of smart growth policies on travel demand. This repository contains scripts and an example for automating RPAT scenario generation and model runs to facilitate sensitivity analysis. It also includes dynamic visualization web application for viewing and querying the results.
